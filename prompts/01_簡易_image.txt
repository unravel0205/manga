【優先順位ヒエラルキー - プロンプト全体に適用】
⚠️ この優先順位がプロンプト全体の指示を統制します:

■ レベル1：絶対必須（必ず守る、同時に適用される）
  1️⃣ アートスタイル適用：{{STYLE_PROMPT}}を全パネルに完全適用
     → 「どう描くか」（描画技法、誇張度、美的表現）を決定

  2️⃣ 参照画像の忠実再現：参照画像が提供された場合、キャラクターデザインを忠実に再現
     → 「キャラクターの見た目」（参照画像内でアートスタイルの枠組み内）を決定

  3️⃣ 日本語テキスト品質：全吹き出しに明瞭で読みやすい縦書き日本語
     → テキストの可読性と正確性を保証

■ レベル2：コンテンツ指示（レベル1の制約内で正確に従う）
  4️⃣ ユーザー指定コンテンツ：パネルごとの具体的指示に100%従う
     → 「何を描くか」（セリフ、背景、シーン）を決定

  5️⃣ ストーリー全般：未指定要素に対してストーリー内容を使用
     → 創作的判断のコンテキストを提供

■ レベル3：品質基準（重要だが柔軟性あり）
  6️⃣ 構図バリエーション：アングル、距離感、背景タイプを変化させる
     → 視覚的な豊かさを確保

  7️⃣ キャラクター不在パネル：ストーリー固有の非キャラパネルを1つ含める
     → 物語の深みとペース配分を追加

🔑 重要原則:
・レベル1の項目は「協調して機能」し、対立しない
・アートスタイル = 「描画方法」、コンテンツ指定 = 「描画内容」
・上位レベルが下位レベルより優先される
・レベル1要件をレベル2・3のために犠牲にしてはならない

【CRITICAL: REFERENCE IMAGE FIDELITY】
⚠️ レベル1-2 優先順位 - 上記の優先順位ヒエラルキーを参照:

If a reference image is provided:
- Faithfully reproduce the character design and art style
- Accurately maintain: facial features, hairstyle, hair color, clothing, line weight, coloring, color tone
- Do not add excessive personal interpretation or modifications
- Character appearance must remain consistent across all panels
- The reference image defines the visual identity - follow it precisely

⚠️ CRITICAL CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENT:
When generating multiple images in sequence, maintain ABSOLUTE CONSISTENCY:
- Use IDENTICAL art style, line weight, coloring technique across ALL generations
- Character design must remain EXACTLY the same in every image
- Color palette, saturation levels, contrast must be CONSISTENT
- Background rendering style must be UNIFORM
- Do NOT introduce style variations between sequential generations
- Treat this as a continuous series requiring perfect visual coherence

---
【CRITICAL: JAPANESE TEXT RENDERING】
⚠️ レベル1-3 優先順位 - 上記の優先順位ヒエラルキーを参照:

■ Language & Script Requirements
- ALL speech bubbles MUST contain Japanese text (日本語のみ)
- Use authentic Japanese hiragana (ひらがな), katakana (カタカナ), and kanji (漢字) characters
- ABSOLUTELY NO English text, NO romanization, NO placeholder text like "[Japanese text]"
- Every speech bubble must display real, readable Japanese characters

■ Writing Direction & Layout
- Vertical writing (縦書き) - text flows from top to bottom
- Reading order: Right to left (右→左)
- Each character must be stacked vertically in columns
- Multiple columns read from right to left

■ Text Quality Standards
- Characters must be crystal clear, perfectly legible, and properly formed
- Professional manga-style font rendering
- Appropriate font size for speech bubbles (readable but not oversized)
- Natural Japanese spacing and line breaks
- Sharp, clean character rendering (not blurry or distorted)

■ Font Specifications
- Use clear, simple Japanese font for maximum readability
- Avoid decorative or overly stylized fonts that reduce legibility
- Font should render each character distinctly without blurring

■ Speech Bubble Integration
- Text must be properly positioned within speech bubbles
- Bubble shapes: Normal speech → Round, Thought → Cloud-shaped, Surprise → Spiky
- Text placement follows reading order (top-right → bottom-left)
- Maximum 2 bubbles per panel

⚠️ CRITICAL: Speech Bubble Placement for 2-Character Panels
When 2 characters are present with dialogue in the same panel:
- First speaker's bubble: RIGHT side of the panel (右側)
- Second speaker's bubble: LEFT side of the panel (左側)
- Reading flows RIGHT → LEFT (1st speaker → 2nd speaker)
- NEVER place first speaker on left and second speaker on right

Example correct placement:
  [1st character speaks] ← RIGHT | LEFT → [2nd character responds]

■ 吹き出し配置ルール（2キャラパネル）
2人のキャラクターが会話する場合:
- 1人目のセリフ: パネル右側に配置
- 2人目のセリフ: パネル左側に配置
- 読み順: 右→左（1人目→2人目）
- 絶対に1人目を左、2人目を右に配置しないこと

【ART STYLE AND COLORING】
🎨 CRITICAL - THIS IS YOUR PRIMARY DIRECTIVE - ALWAYS ACTIVE:

{{STYLE_PROMPT}}

⚠️ MANDATORY APPLICATION RULES:
- This art style MUST be applied to ALL panels without exception
- This art style defines HOW you draw everything: characters, backgrounds, objects, effects
- Apply FULL stylistic exaggeration and characteristics as specified above
- User content specifications (dialogue, backgrounds, etc.) tell you WHAT to include, but THIS STYLE controls HOW you render them
- NEVER reduce or simplify this style for any reason
- If the style calls for bold exaggeration, use it. If it calls for delicate details, use them. If it calls for dramatic effects, use them.

Additional style requirements:
- Clear, defined lines with strong outlines (as appropriate to the selected style)
- Vivid, saturated colors (not washed out or hazy, unless the selected style specifically calls for soft/muted tones)
- Strong contrast with sharp definition (as characteristic of the selected style)
- Use shadows and highlights for depth (stylized according to the selected art style)
- Never pale, faded, or low-contrast finish (unless specifically part of the selected style aesthetic)
- Professional manga-quality rendering with full commitment to the selected style

🔁 REMINDER: This style applies to EVERYTHING you draw in ALL panels, regardless of any other specifications.

【SPEECH RULES】
{{SPEECH_STYLE}}

■ Character Count Guidelines (for character-present panels)
- 1 speech bubble: 20-25 characters recommended
- 2 speech bubbles: 30-35 characters total (e.g., 18+17)
- Maximum per bubble: 25 characters
- Maximum per panel: 35 characters
- Total across character-present panels: 70-90 characters (ideal: 75-85)

■ Speech Distribution (for 2-character setup)
- Explainer: ~70% of total dialogue
- Questioner: ~30% of total dialogue
- Explainer provides main information, questioner asks questions and responds

■ Dialogue Variety Requirements
- Do NOT repeat the same content across panels (even with different wording)
- Vary sentence endings across all panels
- Avoid overly explanatory long sentences
- Stay true to the story - no exaggeration or added facts

■ Techniques for Adequate Character Count
- Expand short questions: "幸せって何？" → "幸せって一体何なんだろう？"
- Add specific details: "時代で変わる" → "時代や文化によって大きく変わってくるものなんだ"

---
【CHARACTER-ABSENT PANELS】
{{CHARACTER_RULE}}

■ Five Panel Types to Choose From:

**Type A - 概念のイメージカット (Concept Visualization)**
- Visual metaphors for abstract concepts
- Use symbolic imagery, silhouettes, light/shadow effects
- Examples: happiness → warm light embracing family silhouettes, growth → seedling to tree
- When to use: Philosophical themes, abstract concept explanations

**Type B - 手元・部分のクローズアップ (Hand/Object Close-up)**
- Focus on specific objects or detailed actions
- Show hands with items, device screens, documents
- Examples: hand signing paper, smartphone screen, fingers holding photo
- When to use: Before/after important actions, presenting key items

**Type C - 図解・ダイアグラム (Diagram/Infographic)**
- Structured information visualization
- Use charts, graphs, timelines, comparison tables, flowcharts
- Examples: pie chart (past 70% family vs present 50% individual), historical timeline
- When to use: Comparing multiple elements, explaining processes, showing relationships

**Type D - 吹き出しなし＋背景・風景 (Landscape without Speech)**
- Show location, setting, or atmosphere
- Depict specific places or time period ambiance
- Examples: sunset park, busy office, quiet library, Showa-era street
- When to use: Scene transitions, establishing time period, reflecting emotions

**Type E - たとえ話のビジュアル化 (Metaphor Visualization)**
- Illustrate analogies mentioned in the story
- Directly visualize comparisons from the narrative
- Examples: "life is a voyage" → ship in storm vs calm harbor
- When to use: Following metaphorical expressions, explaining concepts through examples

■ Panel Selection Guidelines
- If story has comparison/contrast → C (Diagram) or A (Concept)
- If specific object/action is important → B (Close-up)
- If location/era is important → D (Landscape)
- If metaphor is used in story → E (Metaphor visualization)

■ Examples of Good vs Bad
× Bad: "価値観の変遷" (too abstract, works for any story)
○ Good: "幸せの基準：家族の安定→個人の成長" with specific visual comparison
× Bad: Generic graph unrelated to story
○ Good: Story-specific comparison showing exact elements mentioned

【PANEL COMPOSITION RULES - MANDATORY VARIETY】

■ Camera Angle Variety (MUST use at least 2-3 different angles across all panels)
Choose from these 6 angle types:
1. Front view - Direct eye contact, standard angle
2. 3/4 view (45-degree) - Natural, dynamic angle with slight side view
3. Profile (Side view) - Shows emotional changes, contemplative moments
4. Bird's eye view (Overhead) - Looking down, shows overall situation
5. Low angle (Worm's eye) - Looking up, emphasizes importance or power
6. Back view - Character facing away, thinking or gazing

■ Camera Distance Variety (MUST use at least 2-3 different distances across all panels)
Choose from these 5 distance types:
1. Close-up - Face only, shows subtle expression changes
2. Bust shot - Upper body from chest up, good for conversation
3. Waist shot - From waist up, shows gestures and body language
4. Full body - Entire character, shows movement and full posture
5. Wide shot - Character with environment, establishes location

■ Expression Variety
- Change facial expressions to match panel emotion
- Options: Confusion / Anxiety / Serious / Realization / Relief / Smile / Understanding

■ CRITICAL - DO NOT:
× Use the same angle for all panels (variation is MANDATORY)
× Use the same expression for all panels
× Use the same camera distance for all panels
× Create monotonous compositions

---
【BACKGROUND RULES - MANDATORY VARIETY】

■ Use at least 2-3 different background types across all panels:

Type A - Location/Scene: Study room, office, natural scenery
Type B - Conceptual Image: Historical figures, abstract concepts
Type C - Infographic: Charts, flow diagrams, icons
Type D - Light Effects: Sparkles, radial light (for realization moments)
Type E - Nature/Seasonal: Cherry blossoms, blue sky, sunlight through trees

**Note**: For styles with inherent constraints (limited color palettes, monochrome techniques, minimalist aesthetics), achieve background variety through composition, lighting, shapes, and negative space rather than color variation. Style integrity takes priority over color-based variety.

■ Emotion-Background Matching:
- Anxiety/Confusion → Calm gray tones, muted colors
- Surprise/Discovery → Radial light burst, bright highlights
- Understanding → Sparkle effects, organized diagrams
- Relief/Hope → Natural scenery, open sky, warm colors

■ DO NOT:
× Use plain white or simple gradient for all panels
× Use identical backgrounds throughout

⚠️ CRITICAL: USER-SPECIFIED CONTENT INSTRUCTIONS

⚠️ 優先順位ヒエラルキーを参照してください。
アートスタイル（レベル1-1）とユーザーコンテンツ（レベル2-4）は協調して機能します。

If the story content contains specific panel-by-panel instructions using markers like 【パネル1】, 【パネル2】, [Panel 1], etc., you MUST follow them with 100% FIDELITY:

🎨 リマインダー: アートスタイル + ユーザーコンテンツは協調動作
- アートスタイル（レベル1-1）：全要素を「どう描くか」
- ユーザーコンテンツ（レベル2-4）：各パネルに「何を含めるか」
- これらは補完的であり、対立しない

**HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER:**
- User says "Background: office" → Draw an office IN THE SELECTED ART STYLE (exaggerated, stylized, with all style characteristics)
- User says "Speech: こんにちは" → Use exact text "こんにちは" BUT render the bubble/lettering IN THE SELECTED ART STYLE
- User says "Expression: happy" → Show happy expression WITH FULL STYLISTIC EXAGGERATION from {{STYLE_PROMPT}}

■ What to Follow Exactly (CONTENT specifications):
- Specified dialogue/speech (セリフ/Speech): Use EXACTLY as written, word for word (but render in selected art style)
- Specified background (背景/Background): Reproduce EXACTLY as described (but draw in selected art style)
- Specified scene/setting (シーン/Scene): Follow EXACTLY (but render in selected art style)
- Specified character presence/absence (キャラ/Character): Follow EXACTLY (but draw in selected art style)
- Specified panel type (タイプ/Type): Follow EXACTLY (but render in selected art style)
- Specified camera angles/distance: Follow EXACTLY (but render in selected art style)
- Specified emotions/expressions: Follow EXACTLY (but exaggerate in selected art style)
- Any other explicit CONTENT instructions: Follow EXACTLY (but render in selected art style)

■ What to Create:
- Only fill in CONTENT aspects that are NOT specified
- If dialogue is given, use it verbatim - do NOT rephrase
- If background is described, include those exact elements - do NOT add elements not mentioned
- Creative freedom applies ONLY to unspecified CONTENT elements
- ALWAYS apply the full art style regardless of what content is specified

⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDER: Art Style is ALWAYS Active
- Do NOT reduce exaggeration because user specified a background
- Do NOT simplify the style because user specified dialogue
- Do NOT make the art more "realistic" or "plain" when following user specs
- User specifications = WHAT to draw | Art style = HOW to draw it
- These are TWO DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS that work together simultaneously

■ Examples of Correct Application:
✓ User says: 背景:オフィス会議室 | {{STYLE_PROMPT}}=Pop art style
  → Draw office meeting room with bold colors, halftone dots, thick outlines, dramatic shadows (full pop art style)
✓ User says: セリフ:「今日は晴れ」 | {{STYLE_PROMPT}}=Retro shoujo manga
  → Use exact text "今日は晴れ" in a decorative bubble with sparkles, flowers, soft shading (full retro shoujo style)
✓ User says: 表情:驚き | {{STYLE_PROMPT}}=Gag manga style
  → Show surprise with EXTREME exaggeration, bulging eyes, speed lines, distorted face (full gag manga style)

■ Examples of WRONG Application:
✗ User specified "office" so I'll draw it simply and realistically → NO! Draw it in the FULL selected art style
✗ User specified exact dialogue so I'll make the panel plain → NO! Apply FULL art style to everything
✗ User gave specific instructions so I'll reduce stylistic exaggeration → NO! ALWAYS use full style

---
⚠️ ABSOLUTE RULE: NEVER SACRIFICE ART STYLE FOR CONTENT ACCURACY
- You can be 100% accurate to user content specifications AND 100% faithful to art style simultaneously
- User content specs = WHAT elements appear | Art style = HOW they're rendered
- If you find yourself thinking "I should simplify the style to follow user specs accurately" - STOP. You're wrong.
- The correct approach: "I will include exactly what user specified, rendered in the FULL selected art style"

【PANEL CREATION INSTRUCTIONS】

Based on the story above, create a manga following these steps:

1. **Analyze the Story**
   - Identify the core theme and key points
   - Determine emotional flow across all panels
   - Plan where character-absent panel works best (if applicable)

2. **Design Speech Content**
   - Write Japanese dialogue for character-present panels
   - Total character-present dialogue: 70-90 characters (ideal: 75-85)
   - Follow distribution: explainer 70%, questioner 30%
   - Ensure variety - no repeated content
   - Use story-specific keywords

3. **Plan Character-Absent Panels**
   - Select 1 panel for character-absent treatment
   - Choose appropriate type from A-E based on story content
   - Create story-specific titles (10 chars max)
   - Design visuals reflecting specific story elements

4. **Vary Composition**
   - Use at least 3 different camera angles
   - Use at least 3 different camera distances
   - Change expressions to match emotions
   - Use at least 3 different background types

5. **Render the Final Image**
   - {{PANEL_COUNT}} panels in vertical composition, 2:3 aspect ratio, 4K resolution
   - Faithfully follow reference image character design (if provided)
   - Render Japanese text clearly in vertical writing (top-to-bottom, right-to-left)
   - Apply selected art style consistently
   - Ensure vivid colors and strong contrast
   - Define panel borders clearly

---
【STYLE PRIORITY】

When style-specific requirements conflict with general guidelines:
- Art style characteristics take HIGHEST priority
- Maintain authentic style integrity (color limits, techniques, aesthetics)
- Adapt variety requirements to work within style constraints
- Example: Minimalist styles achieve variety through composition, not color
- Example: Retro manga may use screen tone techniques even in color context
- Example: Webtoon-style language refers to aesthetic, not actual scroll format
