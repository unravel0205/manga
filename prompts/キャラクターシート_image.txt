× Change character design between sections (hair, clothes, etc.)
× Use different art styles across sections
× Create manga panels or comic strips - this is a CHARACTER SHEET
× Add speech bubbles or dialogue
× Include backgrounds or scenes - keep it simple and professional
× Make the character different ages or sizes across sections
× Add unnecessary decorative elements that obscure the character
