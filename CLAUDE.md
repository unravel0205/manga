## Conventions for AI Assistants

### General Guidelines

- The project description is in Japanese; respect bilingual context when appropriate
- Keep commits atomic and descriptive
- Prefer simple, minimal implementations over over-engineered solutions
- Do not add unnecessary abstractions or utilities beyond what is needed

### When Adding Code

- Establish clear directory structure conventions early (e.g., `src/`, `tests/`, `public/`)
- Include a `.gitignore` appropriate to the chosen tech stack
- Add dependency management files (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, etc.) as needed
- Set up linting/formatting configuration early to maintain consistency

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, concise commit messages
- Reference what was added/changed and why
- Follow conventional commit style when appropriate (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)

### Testing

- No test infrastructure exists yet
- When tests are added, document how to run them here
- Commands: (to be defined)

### Building and Running

- No build or run configuration exists yet
- When defined, document commands here
- Commands: (to be defined)

## Architecture Notes
